# linux-setup
Shell scripts to set up a new Linux computer the way I like it.
Currently only tested on Ubuntu linux.
I don't recommend you run it without looking at what it does.
Hope you all enjoy!

# Instructions
1. Run `linux_setup.sh` with an email argument.
2. Optionally add contents from `bash_aliases.sh` to `~/.bash_aliases`
3. Optionally add contents from `bashrc_additions.sh` to `~/.bashrc`
4. Install anything else that I have scripts for.

# Other Programs
Consider installing the following:
- Anki
- VLC media player
- google chrome
- Zotero
- Sox (audio files)

# Programming languages to maybe install
- java
- julia
- R
